### Abstract 
Referring Image Segmentation is a comprehensive task to segment an object referred by a textual query from an image. In nature, the level of difficulty in this task is affected by the existence of similar objects and the complexity of the referring expression. Recent RIS models still dshow a significant performance gap between easy and hard scenarios. We pose that the bottleneck exists in the data, and propose a simple but powerful data augmentation method, Negative-mined Mosaic Augmentation (NeMo). This method augments a training image into a mosaic with three other negative images carefully curated by a pretrained multimodal alignment model, e.g., CLIP, to make the sample more challenging. We discover that it is critical to properly adjust the difficulty level, neither too ambiguous nor too trivial. The augmented training data encourages the RIS model to recognize subtle differences and relationships between similar visual entities and to concretely understand the whole expression to locate the right target better. Our approach shows consistent improvements on various datasets and models, verified by extensive experiments.

## üéôÔ∏è News
[2024/09/19] Initial code release

## ‚úèÔ∏è Note
We release the dataloder code for NeMo, which augments each image by combining it with three hard negatives to create a mosaic. This dataloader code is based on the implementation code of [CRIS](https://github.com/DerrickWang005/CRIS.pytorch). Please refer to this repository for more details. Also, LMDB files for each dataset are need to load the image pool.
